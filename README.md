# Simpson Script Generator

In this project, we'll generate our own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. we'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
